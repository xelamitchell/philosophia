/**
 * MFD defines and explains reality. Based on the Rule of Three MFD can be
 * broken into the following elements:
 * <p>
 * <pre>
 * M (Mind): The mental aspect of reality
 * F (Fact): The physical aspect of reality
 * D (Done): The end of reality
 * </pre>
 * </p>
 * Notice, however, that the letters are all interchangeable in terms of meaning
 * (M could refer to "Mass" while D may also mean "Dimension": both physical
 * aspects of reality) but are always in the order 'M' followed by 'F' followed
 * by 'D'.
